# Resume Project Summary

## One-Line Description

CodeCoDriver is a repository-aware multi-agent engineering runtime that plans code changes, retrieves source context, generates and validates patches in a sandbox, reviews evidence, and learns from historical execution memory.

## Resume Bullets

- Built a Go multi-agent runtime with Planner, Codebase, Patch, Test, and Reviewer agents, bounded repair loops, PostgreSQL state persistence, task cancellation, startup recovery, and auditable Run/Step/Artifact traces.
- Implemented a configurable SkillRegistry, variable-rendered PromptTemplates, and a TaskRouter that selects workflows by task keywords, repository path patterns, explicit task skill, and memory similarity, with per-run skill selection artifacts.
- Implemented repository-aware retrieval with safe path boundaries, symbol indexing, structured execution memory, LLM memory refinement, similarity deduplication, conflict resolution, memory-to-task/file/symbol links, agent-loop failure recording, Doubao embedding persistence in pgvector halfvec with HNSW indexing, hybrid keyword/cosine search, freshness decay, and access-frequency reranking.
- Integrated Python document processing and MCP JSON-RPC tools behind a policy-controlled Tool Gateway with per-Agent allowlists, timeouts, retries, and persisted ToolCall audit records.
- Delivered a React/TypeScript evaluation console with task timelines, tool and LLM usage traces, benchmark suites, Agent/Baseline comparisons, batch progress, and historical pass-rate snapshots.
- Added operational protections including per-client API rate limiting, HTTP timeouts, DeepSeek token/latency/cost tracking, reproducible demo data, and PostgreSQL-backed evaluation metrics.

## Technical Focus

Go, PostgreSQL, React, TypeScript, DeepSeek API, Python sidecar, MCP, JSON-RPC, sandboxed Git patch validation, multi-agent orchestration, long-term memory retrieval, and runtime reliability.

## Demo Repository

The primary reproducible demo uses `qiangxue/go-rest-api` (MIT licensed, shallow-cloned by the seed script) because it is small enough for a live walkthrough while still exercising layered Go HTTP, authentication, database, validation, and test retrieval. `ardanlabs/service` is retained as an optional larger-repository stress sample.
