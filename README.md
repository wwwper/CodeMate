# CodeCoDriver

CodeCoDriver is a repository-aware multi-agent engineering runtime. It indexes a local codebase, accepts an engineering task, plans the work, retrieves relevant code, proposes a patch, validates it in a sandbox, reviews the result, records an auditable trace, and reuses long-term memory across tasks.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites: Go, Node.js/npm, Docker Desktop, and a `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.

1. Start PostgreSQL and Redis:

```powershell
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

2. Start the Go API:

```powershell
$env:DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key"
$env:DOUBAO_API_KEY="your-doubao-api-key"
$env:GOTELEMETRY="off"
go run ./cmd/api
```

Set `DOUBAO_API_KEY` to enable real semantic embeddings through Volcano Ark's
`doubao-embedding-text-240715` model. If it is not set, CodeCoDriver falls back to
the deterministic local embedding provider so local development still works.

Set `CODECODRIVER_REDIS_ADDR=localhost:6379` before starting the API to enable Redis leases and multi-worker coordination. Without this variable, the runtime falls back to the single-process in-memory queue.

3. Start the Dashboard:

```powershell
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. The API listens on `http://localhost:8080`, and Vite proxies API requests to it.

4. Seed the demo repository and benchmark cases:

```powershell
./scripts/seed-demo.ps1
```

This registers the local `demo/go-rest-api` repository and creates benchmark cases so the Dashboard can be used immediately.

## Dashboard Pages

### Overview

The Overview page is the main entry point:

- Register a new repository by entering a repository name and a local filesystem path, then click `Register repo`.
- Create an engineering task by selecting a repository, an optional Skill (defaults to auto routing), a title, and a description, then clicking `Create task`.
- Review runtime metrics: active runs, completed tasks, human reviews, average runtime, completion rate, and failed tasks.
- Click a recent task to jump into its execution trace.

### Task Trace

The Task Trace page shows all tasks and a detailed audit trail for the selected task:

- Click any task in the left list to load its timeline.
- The timeline shows Planner, Codebase, Patch, Test, Reviewer, ToolCall, and LLM usage events.
- If a task is `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, enter an optional decision reason and click `Approve` or `Reject`.
- You can also type free-form feedback and click `Send feedback & continue`. The task re-enters the Agent loop with your feedback plus the previous review and patch, enabling multi-turn chat-like iteration; a `go test ...` command in feedback overrides this run's sandbox test command.
- `code-explainer` tasks render as a chat thread at the top of Task Trace, with Markdown-formatted assistant replies.
- Completed `code-explainer` tasks keep a chat input so you can continue asking follow-up questions.
- For normal patch review, approval completes the task and rejection marks it failed.
- If the Planner detects from successful memory and the current file tree that the deliverable already exists, the UI shows `Accept skip` / `Continue anyway`. Accepting ends the task; continuing re-queues it for real execution instead of marking it failed.
- Approving marks the task completed; rejecting marks it failed.
- Agent runs never mutate the original repository. Every file-related tool operates on a per-task Docker workspace, and the generated patch is kept as a `patch_proposal` artifact for manual review or downstream application.

### Memory

The Memory page inspects repository-scoped long-term memory:

- Enter the repository ID in the `Repository ID` field. The ID is printed by `seed-demo.ps1` and shown in the repository selector.
- Enter a query such as `retry timeout` or `pagination validation`.
- Click `Search memory` to see memory hits with kind, score, source, recall count, and creation time.

### Skills

The Skills page shows the current PromptTemplate and Skill registry:

- Task creation supports `Auto route` or an explicit `skill_name`. Auto routing is handled by TaskRouter using task keywords, repository paths, and memory hits.
- Each Skill contains `keywords`, `path_patterns`, `workflow`, `prompts`, and `allowed_tools`, so prompts can be iterated independently.
- `code-explainer` is a read-only explanation Skill. Tasks asking how a feature works, architecture, files, functions, or abstractions are routed automatically and produce a Markdown `explanation` artifact without generating patches.
- Skills live in the `skills/` directory, one `.json` file per Skill. You can add or edit files manually.
- After manually adding files, click `Reload folder` on the Skills page or call `POST /skills/reload` to rescan immediately.
- The Skills page accepts a GitHub repository or `.json` file URL and calls `POST /skills/import` to download valid Skills into `skills/`.
- `POST /skills` also persists a Skill to `skills/`; set `CODECODRIVER_SKILLS_DIR` to change the directory.
- Each run records a `skill_selection` artifact with the matched Skill, workflow, scores, and routing reason.

### Evaluation

The Evaluation page runs and compares benchmark cases:

- Select `Agent` or `Baseline` mode.
- Click `Run suite` to execute all registered benchmark cases as one batch.
- Review pass rate, total runs, benchmark cases, recent batches, metric history, agent-versus-baseline comparison, and individual run results.
- Memory A/B modes `with_memory` and `without_memory` can be passed as evaluation modes to compare memory impact.
- Pass rate is calculated only over completed runs; `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` is reported separately and does not lower the pass-rate denominator.
- Benchmarks cover testing, documentation, security, explanation, and refactoring tasks. Evaluation runs auto-cover human-review steps and record `auto_human` actions.
- Run `./scripts/run-eval-suite.ps1 -Mode agent` to launch a standardized suite; reports are written to `test-reports/`.
- `GET /evaluations/report` returns per-task quality scores, token/cost usage, per-Agent calls, repair effort, artifacts, and expected-path hits for prompt optimization.

## Typical Workflow

1. Start PostgreSQL, API, and the Dashboard.
2. Run `seed-demo.ps1` if you want a reproducible demo repository.
3. In Overview, register another repository or create a task for the demo repository.
4. Open Task Trace to inspect each Agent step and failure evidence.
5. If the runtime requests human review, approve or reject the task from the trace page.
6. Search Memory for related historical experience before starting a similar task.
7. Run an Evaluation suite to measure Agent performance against the benchmark.

## How It Works

- `Planner Agent` creates an execution plan and, on repair attempts, creates a focused repair plan.
- Before planning, Planner checks similar successful memories against the current file tree. If the target deliverable already exists, it returns `SKIP_SUGGESTED` and waits for human confirmation instead of regenerating a duplicate patch.
- `SkillRegistry` stores configurable prompt skills, `PromptTemplate` handles variable rendering, and `TaskRouter` routes tasks before the Agent loop starts. Agents prefer selected-skill prompts and fall back to built-in generic rules.
- `explanation_agent_loop` runs only Planner, Codebase, and Explainer read-only steps, then completes with an `explanation` artifact instead of entering the Patch/Test/Reviewer repair chain.
- `Codebase Agent` retrieves relevant files and pairs source files with existing test files when the task asks for test coverage.
- `Patch Agent` edits files only inside the isolated Docker workspace using `read_file`, `search_files`, `read_symbols`, `edit_file`, and `write_file`; it calls `generate_patch` to produce a real `git diff` instead of hand-writing a unified diff.
- Every file-related tool runs inside one per-task Docker workspace. The host repository is imported into a named volume rather than bind-mounted, and `search_files`/`read_symbols` execute `ripgrep` inside that container. The same workspace is used to run tests, so the original repository is never modified.
- `Reviewer Agent` checks correctness, regression risk, evidence, and test coverage before approving a proposal.
- Distributed workers acquire Redis leases for task IDs, renew them during execution, release them afterward, and use fencing tokens so stale workers cannot overwrite current task state.
- Long-term memory stores execution summaries, success patterns, and failure patterns with structured fields such as symptom, root cause, changed files, symbols, test command, verification evidence, and success score. An asynchronous memory worker batches DeepSeek refinement jobs, deduplicates near-identical entries, and merges contradictory success/failure pairs into conditional resolved patterns. Retrieval prioritizes success/resolved/refined memory and only injects failure patterns when the symptom or root cause is relevant. Each memory can be linked to its source task, run, files, and symbols. Doubao embeddings are persisted in pgvector `halfvec(2560)` with an HNSW index, and recall combines semantic, keyword, freshness, and access-frequency signals. Mid-loop agent failures are also recorded so future tasks can avoid the same stage-level errors.
- `Tool Gateway` supports workspace-contained file tools, the Python document sidecar, and MCP JSON-RPC stdio servers.

The runtime uses DeepSeek's OpenAI-compatible API with the `deepseek-v4-flash` model.

## Current Status

CodeCoDriver is a local engineering-runtime prototype. It supports real task execution in a Docker workspace, long-term memory, distributed worker leases, Dashboard operation, and benchmark evaluation, but it is not yet a production multi-user product: there is no authentication, the Docker workspace isolates file tools rather than the whole Agent process, and benchmark results depend on model output quality.
